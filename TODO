MWBE 1.0b

This TODO is pretty much in order of importance to me

Add functionality for editing mixes
Add functionality for uploading single or multiple mp3s instead of a zip file
Add more background sanity checking
Add sqlite DB for storing admin user/pass
Remove .htpasswd and .htaccess
Add mix handling to sqlite DB and move away from some of the xml processing
Clean up code even more
