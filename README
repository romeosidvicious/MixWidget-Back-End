So far this is just a drop in back end for mixwidget.

This is the 0.1 ALPHA release so if this scrip crashes your web host, rapes your cat, makes you blind or any other thing you think it oughtn't have done then you are on your own.

There are no installation instructions yet and won't be for a while. If you upload this to your webhost and don't secure the admin directory you may well have all sorts of crap uploaded to your account in no time flat.

In other words don't use this, it's not ready. It will be soon but it's not now. If you use you do so at your own risk.
