This is an ALPHA release so if this scrip crashes your web host, rapes your cat, makes you blind or any other thing you think it oughtn't have done then you are on your own. If you upload this to your webhost and don't secure the admin directory you may well have all sorts of crap uploaded to your account in no time flat. In other words don't use this, it's not ready. It will be soon but it's not now. If you use you do so at your own risk. If you still want to use this it's a simple drop-in backend for Mix Widget that allows you to upload a zip file of MP3s and then goes to work and spits out a functional Mix Widget for you. If you still want to install this then see the included INSTALL file. For planned features and current development path see the TODO file included in this release.
