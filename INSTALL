Upload the MWBE tar.gz to your server.
Login in to your shell and extract MWBE into whatever directory you wish.
Edit admin/includes/mwbe_conf.php and put in the path to your MWBE install. (This path is relative to the docroot on your webseverver.)
Change the admin password in admin/.htpasswd

whatever dir you uploaded MWBE to
archives/
confs/

Go to http://www.clockwatchers.com/htaccess_tool.html and scroll down to 2. .htpasswd Tool
Put in a username and password and click Create It
Go to the admin directory in the directory you just extracted the files and open .htpasswd with a text editor (notepad NOT wordpad)
Delete the current username and password in .htpasswd and paste in the results from clockwatchers.com
Open admin/includes/mwbe_conf.php in a text editor change the $mwbe_dir variable to match the directory you plan to upload MWBE to.
