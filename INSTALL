I will provide ftp directions and such once this is ready for prime time. Until then you get this:

Place all files in a web accessible directory
Password protect admin/
Run admin/mwbe.php?action=validate
Create any missing directories
Fix any permission problems
Start making mixes

THIS SCRIPT LETS FILES BE UPLOADED TO YOUR WEBHOST
IF YOU DON'T PASSWORD PROTECT /admin DO NOT WHINE TO ME WHEN YOUR SEVER GETS 0WNED.

I do not provide instructions on how to password protect your directory because if you don't know how already then this script isn't ready for you to use.
